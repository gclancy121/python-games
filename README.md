# python-games
A small collection of easy-to-make games that I'm learning Python with.

LIST OF CURRENT GAMES:


calculator: not really a game, but I want to learn more and calculators are an easy way to get familiar with a language.
rps: Rock, Paper, Scissors. Who doesn't know rock paper scissors?
mad-libs: Mad Libs. You get a pseudo-random prompt and you have to fill in the missing words to complete the sentences. Still kind of WIP since there aren't very many libs to work off of, but it gets the point across.
